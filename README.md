# Catch Me If You Can
Catch Me If You Can is a game to test the players reaction time.  In a playful setting the goal is for the player to 
click on as many items possible before the set timeframe of the game ends. The target items will show themselfes randomly on the webpage in position 
as well as within various time intervals. The score is based on the reaction time.

## UX
My aim is to present a game that is easy to understand and play for all ages. The game is presented on a mobile friendly and easy to 
navigate web site. Accessible on all platforms to play the game on the go, or in the comforts of their home.

On entering the web site the player shall directly understand how to play the game and the positive expected outcome by a welcoming text
 centered on the page. The headline is stating the purpose of the game and the centered start button, visually enforced by a stark 
 contrasting color, show how to engage with the game.

 While playing, the player is able to see the score increase as well as the reactiontime between each "clicked" target. My intention is that 
 the player is given instant feedback on their performance and motivate interaction with the game.

 The game ends after x time and a pop up box display the final score with an option to resume the game or return to the home page.

***Player 1***
 > I am a new player and I want to spend some short offtime while playing a fun game to test my performance in some way. I want to have some
 > interaction with the game to feel motivated to keep playing. I want to feel challenged and have the ability to improve my score.

***Player 2***
 > I am a frequent player and I want to improve my score and reactiontime. I compare my score with friends and family and share my results
 > on my social pages.

### Design 
I have chosen the typhography Galindo because of its slight irregularity to give a sense of childish playfulness and gaming. The more 
contemporary typography Prompt is chosen to provide an easy to read and clear message to the player with a lighter font-weight.

![Color scheme](assets/images/color-scheme.png)

The color palette is based on the image of multicolored cubes on the landing site and used througout the web site to be consistent with the theme.
The bright colors with stark contrast is used to enhance the visually hierarchy and guide the player on how to navigate on the web site.

The web site is kept minimalistic in its features to get a modern, timeless feeling and not too be perceived cluttered.

Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
